          <h5>Who am I?</h5>
          <p>
            Hi, my name is Minju Kim. I'm from South Korea. <br />
            I'm really interested in web design and also coding. <br />
            I've had a lot of jobs in my early 20s and now I decided to choose
            the path what I really want to do as professional.<br />
          </p>
          <h5>Why do I apply?</h5>
          <p>
            I would like to meet people who has similar interests.
            <br>
            Making connection between people, also sharing lots of information and knowledge is really important for being developer. 
            <br>
            And at this point, I thought meeting other people not only in online community will make this experience like more vivid.
            <br>
            I applied this FAC programme for my expereince working with other people from a variety of backgrounds.
